# Writing Notes To Self

These are draft notes or a content dumping ground for writing techniques and tricks, especially for researchers. 

## Writing In The Sciences

- Verbs drive sentances, Nouns slow them down
	-  *initiation* -> *to initiate*,  *progression* -> *to progress*,  *expression*->*to expresss*
-  Cut The Clutter
	- "This paper ~~provides a review of~~ **reviews** ~~the basic tanets of~~ cancer biology study design, using ~~an~~ example ~~studies~~ that illustrate the ~~methodologic~~ challenges **and** ~~or that demonstarte succesful~~ solutions ~~to difficulties inherent in biological research~~"

- CHI is a multidisciplinary field with people like Engineers, Social Scientist, Designers, and Practitioners. You have to lead people by the end and explain why your contribution is essential. Justify the decisions you make. Explain the statistical choices (if you are using Tests). Talk about why it matters.
- **Writing Style**: 
	- Do not use interchangeable words. Use the same word over and over again. You don't want to confuse the reviewers.  Use plain language. 
	- "*In order to*" -> "*To*"
	- "*Since*" -> "*Because*"
	- Avoid "*which*" and "*that*"
	- Use "*its*" and "*it*" properly
- **Structure**
	- **Abstract**:  Why are you doing this? What hole are you trying to fill? What you did? What you found?  Why it matters?
	- CHI is not about something not done by others, and then you do it and say what you found. CHI is about, doing something that matters
	- Poorly presented *Introduction* and *Result* suffers instant rejection.  Bad *Related Work* - rebuttable
	- *Hypothesis Testing* is not a story
	- **Content**: 
- **Examples of Great Writing in HCI**
	- Prof. Carl Gutwin
