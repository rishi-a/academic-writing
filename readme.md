# Writing Notes To Self

These are draft notes or a content dumping ground for writing techniques and tricks, especially for researchers. 


## Biggest Mistakes By Newbies in CHI
- CHI is a multidisciplinary field, people from Engineers, Social Scientist, Designers and Practisionaers are involved. You have to lead people by end and explain why your contribution is important. Justify the decisions you make. Explain the statistical choices (if you are using Tests). Talk about why it matters. Who cares
- **Writing Style**: 
	- Do not use interchangable words. Use the same word over and over again. You don't want to confuse the reviewers.  Use plain language. 
	- "*In order to*" -> "*To*"
	- "*Since*" -> "*Because*"
	- Avoid "*which*" and "*that*"
	- Use "*its*" and "*it*" properly
- **Structure**
	- **Abstract**:  Why are you doing this? What hole are you trying to fill? What you did? What you found?  Why it matters?
	- CHI is not about something not done by other and then you do it and say what you found. CHI is about, doing something that matters
	-  Badly presented *Introduction* and *Result* suffers instant rejection.  Bad *Related Work* - rebuttable
	- *Hypothesis Testing* is not a story
	- **Content**: 
- **Examples of Great Writing in HCI**
